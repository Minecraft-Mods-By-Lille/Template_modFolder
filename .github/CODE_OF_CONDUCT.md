# Code of Conduct

**Note:** We want our community to be welcoming and safe for everyone. Please read our Code of Conduct below, which is adapted from the Contributor Covenant.

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information (such as a physical or email address) without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (maintainers of the project) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or community in public spaces. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at **post@edgegaming.no**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other project leaders.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action that violates this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction
Appropriate and fair corrective action for inappropriate language or other unprofessional/unwelcome behavior. A private, written warning may be issued, clarifying the violation and explaining why the behavior was inappropriate. The offender should apologize if necessary.

#### 2. Warning
A violation through a single serious incident or series of actions. A warning is issued outlining consequences for continued behavior. The person should avoid interacting with those involved, including unsolicited interaction with enforcers, for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to further action (temporary or permanent ban).

#### 3. Temporary Ban
A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. A temporary ban from interaction in the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved (or those enforcing the CoC) is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban
Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards or severe harassment/aggression. A permanent ban from all community interaction.
