# Contributing to Minecraft Mod Template by Lille

:tada: Thank you for taking the time to contribute and for seeking out these instructions! Your help is as valuable to us as finding diamonds in Minecraft. The guidelines below will help you get started and ensure your contributions go smoothly.

## Before You Begin

**The goal of these guidelines:** We want to help new contributors feel welcome and learn best practices while contributing to our mods. By following these guidelines, we hope you will:

- Become an active member of our open-source community and the modding community.
- Learn to use GitHub and related tools to craft better software (pun intended 😉).
- Understand how to collaborate with us in developing and improving mods.

**Types of contributions we love:** We're always looking for contributions to help improve our projects. This includes:

- **Translations:** Adding or improving translations for the mod's in-game text.
- **Improvements:** Tweaking or optimizing existing features, and fixing bugs.
- **New ideas:** Suggestions for new features or enhancements to make the mod more fun.

(The game supports many languages – e.g. English, German, French, Spanish, Polish, Chinese, etc. – so translations to any of those or others are welcome!)

## How to Contribute

### Report a Bug

Oops – did you find a bug? Thanks for catching that! If you know how to fix it, you're welcome to fork the repository and submit a fix via a Pull Request. If you're not sure how to fix it (or don't have the time), please open a new issue using the "Bug Report" template. This will prompt you to provide details so we can recreate the error. Don't worry if you're not a coder – bug reports help us a lot!

### Suggest a Feature or Improvement

Have an idea to make the mod better? We 💖 new ideas and suggestions! Please open a Feature Request issue to tell us about your idea. It's often a good idea to discuss it first before you invest a lot of time. This way, we can brainstorm with you and make sure the feature fits the project. Of course, if you're feeling adventurous and want to prototype it yourself, you can always fork the repo and submit a Pull Request with your idea.

### Translate the Mod

Want to see this mod in your language? At this time, we use simple translation files for localization (we've been relying on Google Translate for now – maybe you can help change that 😉). To contribute a translation:

1. Fork this repository and create a new branch for your translation.
2. Locate the mod's language files (usually in a `lang/` folder, e.g. an `en_us.json` for English).
3. **Add your language:** If your language isn't present, copy the English file and rename it to the appropriate locale code (for example, `es_es.json` for Spanish, `de_de.json` for German, etc.).
4. Translate the text inside the file into your language.
5. Double-check your work (feel free to ask native speakers to review!).
6. Submit a pull request with your new or updated translation file.

We'll review the translation, and once it's good to go, we'll merge it in. Thank you for helping players around the world enjoy the mod in their native language!

### Not Sure Where to Start?

If you want to contribute but don't have a specific change in mind, here are some tips: check the existing [open issues](../../issues) for things to tackle, or browse through any [open pull requests](../../pulls) to see ongoing work that might need review or testing. You can also look at the repository's Project board (if available) for planned features or improvements. Helping with testing and feedback is just as valuable as writing code!

## Building and Testing

If you're ready to make changes, it's best to set up the project locally to build and test the mod. Generally, this means:

1. Fork and clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in your development environment (for Minecraft mods, this could involve setting up a modding workspace with Minecraft Forge or Fabric, for example).
3. Make your changes or additions.
4. **Test in-game:** Build/compile the mod and run it in Minecraft to ensure everything works as expected. Look out for errors in the game log and verify that your changes behave as intended.

Once you're happy with your changes, commit them and push to your branch on GitHub. Then you can open a Pull Request for us to review (see below for what to include in a PR).

## Submit a Pull Request

When you've finished a contribution (whether it's a bug fix, feature, or translation), submit a Pull Request (PR). In your PR description, please clearly summarize the changes and reference any related issue (e.g., "Closes #123"). It's helpful to explain why the change is needed or useful. If your PR is a work-in-progress or you'd like feedback early, you can mark it as a draft.

We'll review your pull request as soon as we can. Don't worry if we suggest changes or have questions – it's all part of making the mod the best it can be. 🚀
